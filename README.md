# INRIX-Hack

## Inspiration

- **Current Commuting Challenges**: In many cities, a large number of people commute to work or school daily, often in individual vehicles. This results in heavy traffic congestion, increased carbon emissions, and significant time wasted in transit.

- **Environmental Impact**: The reliance on private vehicles for commuting contributes substantially to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This is a pressing concern in the context of global climate change and environmental degradation.

- **conomic and Time Costs**: The inefficiency of individual commuting not only affects the environment but also has economic implications. Fuel costs, vehicle maintenance, and the time lost in traffic can add up to a significant burden for individuals.

- **Social Aspect**: The solitary nature of these commutes can also contribute to a sense of isolation and a missed opportunity for community building and networking.

## Accomplishments
- **Route Visualization**: Users' routes will be visually represented on a map within the app. Each user's route will be marked with colored dots, differentiating their start and end points.

- **Nearby Partner Identification**: The app will display potential carpool partners who are near the user's start or end points. These potential partners will also be indicated with distinct colored dots for easy identification.

- **Interactive Map Elements**: When a user hovers over these colored dots, a window will zoom out to display the respective user's post. This feature provides a quick and interactive way to view potential carpool partners' details.

- **Direct Communication Option**: If a user finds a potential match interesting, they can directly click on the displayed window to initiate a chat with that person.

## Prospect
To maximize impact, collaboration with local communities and government entities could be explored. This could involve promotional campaigns, incentives for participants, or integration with existing public transport systems. Association with government entities can lend credibility to your program, increasing public trust and participation rates.

- **Long-Term Vision**: Our project could be a stepping stone towards a broader cultural shift in commuting habits, influencing urban planning, and contributing to a more sustainable, interconnected urban community.
